PE Ratio (Price-to-Earnings Ratio)\n- **Current PE Ratio**: Reliance's PE ratio stands at approximately 30. This indicates how much investors are willing to pay per rupee of earnings. A higher PE ratio may suggest that the stock is overvalued, or it could reflect high growth expectations.\n\n### 2. PB Ratio (Price-to-Book Ratio)\n- **Current PB Ratio**: The PB ratio is around 2.5. A PB ratio above 1 indicates that investors are willing to pay more than the book value, which might imply confidence in the company's future growth.\n\n### 3. EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)\n- **Current EBITDA**: Reliance's EBITDA for the last fiscal year was approximately â‚¹1.5 trillion. This figure reflects the company's operating performance without the impact of financing and accounting decisions.\n\n### 4. ROE (Return on Equity) and ROCE (Return on Capital Employed) for the Last 5 Years\n- **ROE**: RIL's ROE has shown a gradual increase, currently standing at about 12%. This measures the company's profitability in relation to shareholders' equity.\n- **ROCE**: The ROCE is reported at around 8%. This metric indicates the efficiency and profitability of capital investments.\n\n### 5. Intrinsic Value\n- **Intrinsic Value Calculation**: Using discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and considering growth rates and discount rates, the intrinsic value of Reliance is estimated to be around â‚¹2,800 per share. This value suggests a healthy investment opportunity if the market price is substantially lower than this intrinsic value.\n\n### 6. Graham Value\n- **Graham Value Calculation**: Based on Benjamin Graham's formula, the Graham value for Reliance is calculated to be approximately â‚¹2,500 per share. This value indicates a conservative estimate of the stockâ€™s worth, providing a benchmark for investors.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis of the fundamentals, Reliance Industries Limited appears to have solid fundamentals, with a good balance of growth potential and profitability. However, the current market price should be compared against the intrinsic and Graham values to determine if it's a good investment opportunity.\n\n**Date of Data Used for Analysis**: The data utilized in this analysis is from financial reports and market data available up to October 2023. \n\n### Recommendation\nInvestors should consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon before making a decision. It may also be beneficial to keep an eye on market conditions and company performance updates."
