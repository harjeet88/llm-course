            "    *   Even more specifically, within the stacks of disc-like structures inside chloroplasts called **thylakoids**. These thylakoids have membranes where all the machinery for this step is located.\n",

            "    *   **Chlorophyll:** This is the special green pigment (the \"solar panel\") embedded in the thylakoid membranes. Its job is to efficiently *absorb* specific wavelengths of light energy. When chlorophyll absorbs light, its electrons get excited, jumping to a higher energy level.\n",

            "    *   **Energy Transfer & Electron Flow:** The absorbed light energy excites electrons within the chlorophyll. These excited electrons are then passed along a series of protein complexes (like a microscopic \"electron transport chain\"). As the electrons move, their energy is used.\n",
            "    *   **Water Splitting (Photolysis):** This is super important! To replace the electrons that left chlorophyll, and to power parts of the electron transport chain, water molecules (H₂O) are split apart.\n",
            "        *   When water splits, it releases:\n",
            "            *   **Electrons:** These replace the ones lost by chlorophyll.\n",
            "            *   **Protons (H⁺ ions):** These build up a concentration gradient that will be used to make ATP.\n",
            "            *   **Oxygen (O₂):** This is a *waste product* for the plant, and it's released into the atmosphere – luckily for us, as it's what we breathe!\n",

            "    *   **NADPH (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate):** This is another energy-carrying molecule, specifically an \"electron carrier.\" Think of it as a shuttle bus carrying high-energy electrons (and protons).\n",
